Tired of worrying about loading models and animations? Ever just wanted to make a sprite 3D, and use a simple 2D sequence to make re-usable animations? Well this might just be for you!
This is more of a tech demo than anything, but could still be useful! This shows how you can take simple sprites, explode them into voxel buffers, and use sequence animations to create 3D animations!
No textures needed. No messing with UV coordinates. No bone weights and skinning!
Everything you need to make 3D models and animations are right inside GM! 
Here it is!

You can also get a nice minecraft look if you just set the exploder smoothing to 0!
